; syscall information of sysread
; %rax		| System call | %rdi			| %rsi				| %rdx	
; 0x20000004| sys_write	  | unsigned int fd | const char *buf	| size_t count
; C prototype : ssize_t	write(int fildes, const void *buf, size_t nbyte);
; rdi = pointer to 1st arg inputed in the function
; rsi = pointer to 2nd arg inputed in the function
; rdx = pointer to 3rd arg inputed in the function
; rax is always the return value register
; rax is also use to store the ID of a system function you want to use
; ex : 0x2000004 = ID to call write system function
; So to call it --> mov rax, 0x2000004
;					syscall; It will take inputs in rdi, rsi, rdx
; When using the standard FreeBSD calling convention, the carry flag is cleared 
; upon success, set upon failure.
